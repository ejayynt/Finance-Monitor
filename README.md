# Finance Monitor

A personal wealth command centre to track expenses and analyse spending habits.

## Design Philosophy
The UI was **completely vibe coded**.

There were no mockups or wireframes. I just kept tweaking the dark mode, glassmorphism, and gold accents until it felt "premium" enough.

## Features
- **Dashboard:** Living donut charts (hover for details) and daily spending velocity graphs.
- **KPIs:** Tracks Monthly Burn, Daily Velocity, and Projected Totals.
- **Quality of Spend:** Visual bar for the 50/30/20 rule (Needs vs. Wants vs. Savings).
- **Stack:** Python (Flask) backend + Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.

##  How to Run

2. Install dependencies (if any).
3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
 4.  Open http://localhost:5000 in your browser.
